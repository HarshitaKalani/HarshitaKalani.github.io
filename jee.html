                                    so yeah, I really like this topic and feel that I can be a helpful resource. My jee experience is a mixed feeling thing. I really enjoyed thos days, cried and laughed altogether. It was my 10th almost to an end and I'd never heard anything about JEE or IIT. During my school time, I used to dream myself as a doctor. After selecting bio as my subject i realised that I wasn't feeling cool. It was becauseee I loved Maths so so much that it was painful for me to let it go. One of my papa's friend suggested him to ask me to go for PCM instead and give JEE then. I felt it as a good idea just because it would mean I would be continuing with maths, lol. 
                                    I joined VMC and here begins the journey. I was a dedicated girl and used to finish all the assignments given by the teachers on a regular basis. Time flies and it was the D-day. I gave my Jee mains paper no. 1 and scored a percentile of 99.2. I and my parents were kinda happy being in the top 0.8percent people but there were people guiding me for my path and made me realise that this wasn't enough. I kept practicing hard and I don't really know when Covid came and went away. I kept studying. It was the second chance - JEE main paper no. 2 and yes, I scored 99.4% this time. Next was JEE advanced. I tried to do my best and secured an AIR of 5588. I'm sitting in IIT Jodhpur right now pursuing BTech in CSE and trust me I'm happy here. I've got to learn so much suring this journey and I definitely made my family and friends proud :)
