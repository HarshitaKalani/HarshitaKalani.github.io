					Embarking on the journey to secure a software development internship was an arduous and demanding
					task for me. The thought of finally sharing my story, from "One day to Day one," fills my stomach
					with butterflies. It may sound as though I consider the struggle monumental, as if I have achieved
					the impossible. That's not entirely true, but for me personally, I have never experienced such
					immense pressure and shed as many tears for anything in my life. <br>
					<br>
					How did I prepare for this endeavor, you may wonder? Well, since my sophomore year, I engaged in
					competitive programming on platforms like HackerRank, CodeChef, and Codeforces. I carried on with
					this pursuit during the precious summer vacations of that same year. Those holidays hold great
					significance in a person's life, I must say. If you prepare diligently, you stand a chance of
					cracking it; otherwise, sadness and tears become constant companions.<br>
					<br>
					I diligently completed Love Babbar's comprehensive set of coding questions, tackling around 10 to 15
					each day, focusing on specific topics. InterviewBit aided me with questions tailored to specific
					companies, while LeetCode proved to be an invaluable platform for acing coding rounds. Clearing
					online assessments and coding rounds in itself posed a significant challenge. It is essential to
					remember that mock interviews are immensely helpful. Seek assistance from friends and lend them your
					support. Together, we can achieve greater things, as two heads are better than one.<br>
					<br>
					I had the opportunity to participate in Google's online assessment, although my score wasn't
					exceptional. Nonetheless, I believe they considered my academic performance, which led to them
					extending an invitation for an interview. The first round went smoothly; the interviewer was
					friendly and asked me questions related to arrays, sorting, and searching, specifically focusing on
					height variations of ±1. Filled with confidence, I immediately called my family to share the good
					news. I dialed Pranav's number, oozing with self-assurance, and assured him that I would undoubtedly
					progress to the next round. And indeed, I did make it through.<br>
					<br>

					The second interview proved to be more challenging. I faced a backtracking question, and, in my
					opinion, I didn't perform up to par. Or perhaps it would be more accurate to say that the other five
					selected candidates outperformed me.<br>

					Verdict: Rejected.<br>
					<br>
					Next in line was Arcesium. My hopes had nearly dwindled, but I went ahead with the first interview.
					They presented me with a question combining graphs and dynamic programming. While I performed well,
					I lacked the confidence to believe I would be selected. Over a meal with Pranav, I shared my story,
					expressing my lack of hope, when suddenly a notification appeared, informing me about the next
					round. The subsequent round delved into the Computer Science Engineering curriculum, covering topics
					like object-oriented programming, database management systems, operating systems, and many others.
					To be honest, my knowledge in those areas was limited, and the interview turned into a journey of
					learning something entirely new.<br>

					Verdict: Rejected.<br>
					<br>
					The story continued. Next up was Uber—a seemingly impossible chance. I participated in the first
					round, alongside three candidates from IITJ in the hiring pool. I remember the spreadsheet, and how,
					in the last 10 minutes, they shifted the time slot from Pranav to me. The first interview revolved
					around system design, followed by a DSA question in the next one, testing my skills in finding the
					longest increasing subsequence. I performed reasonably well, but I believed there were stronger
					candidates from other IITs, which led to my non-selection.<br>

					Verdict: Rejected.<br>
					<br>
					Ah, but it didn't end there. Next on the list was DPA, a surprising choice. The job role centered
					around Data Science, a domain I had never envisioned for myself. During the interview, I
					intentionally refrained from mentioning my knowledge of machine learning, instead focusing on
					full-stack development and software engineering. Playfully, I stumbled through the simple questions
					they asked, fully aware that I was not performing at my best.<br>

					Verdict: Obvious.<br>
					<br>
					And finally, Warner Bros Discovery. The three interviews left me ecstatic, and I was somewhat
					confident about securing a position in this company. And lo and behold, I did it!<br>
