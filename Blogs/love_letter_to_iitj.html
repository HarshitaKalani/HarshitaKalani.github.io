                    IIT Jodhpur will always hold a special place in my heart. Now that I'm in Bangalore, people often
                    say, "You have so many friends here, you must not miss college much." But the truth is, I miss it
                    terribly. Those were the best days of my life. From Freshenza to the farewell, every single day has
                    a memory etched in my mind.
                    I fondly recall the hyperactive WhatsApp groups from Trimester 1. I miss running to the mess, taking
                    early morning lectures at the LHC, the late-night walks, the canteen, the Shamiyana, and of course,
                    the Knowledge Tree—our cherished "circle." I long to return to Kali Pahadi for another sunrise (and
                    peacocks and dogs lol), to witness the mesmerising cloudy evening skies at IITJ. I would love to
                    visit the “city” - Sardarpura especially. And how could I not miss my hostel, the lane connecting B4
                    to B1 and my homies, the bonds that felt like family?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Cycling through the campus is a joy I still yearn for. From AIDS to SOLA, every corner of IITJ is a
                    beauty. And then visiting the THC and places nearby, small world but feels enough today. When I
                    close my eyes, I see us struggling to go to the departments for lectures and DC ofcourse, lol. I see
                    the Mandir, the stars above, and us lying beneath them, talking about life and dreams. I remember us
                    sitting on the bridges, discussing the opportunities we seized and the ones that slipped away. I can
                    still picture us grumbling about the long mess lines, only to climb to the first floor and find an
                    even longer queue there.
                </p>
                <p>
                Being an "Amma" was an indescribable joy, and I was fortunate enough to be the "Nani" to some of the
                best "bacchas" IITJ could offer. I'll forever be grateful to IITJ for the people it gave me—friends
                who've been with me from the very beginning, those who stayed, and even those who drifted away. My
                lobby, the juniors, and the people I got from the trip to Inter IIT - each one of them is a gem.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Pheme and the Music Society were my happy places. And Prometeo, you shaped my love for tech and gave
                    me a new perspective on my passion. Where I am today, I owe a lot to that experience. Spandan and
                    Ignus, though, remain unforgettable—truly the best of all. And oh, how I miss the vibrant
                    celebrations of Navratri and Ganesh Chaturthi! I find myself longing for those magical days.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Oddly enough, I always found it worth attending lectures—not just for the knowledge, but because it
                    was another chance to see my people, to connect, to belong. People say, "Once you get into IIT, life
                    becomes easy." I can assure you, that's far from the truth. There were ups and downs. We cried, we
                    struggled, and fought for what we believed we deserved. But one thing I know for sure: in the end,
                    it all works out. Trust me, everything will fall into place, and you'll find your happiness, just as
                    I did.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I could go on forever, but I'll save some for when we meet. To every place and every person who
                    shaped this journey—you have me, always. I can’t wait to see you all at convocation. See you soon!
                    :)
                </p>
