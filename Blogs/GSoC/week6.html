                <h2>Week 6 of GSoC 2024: Midway Through the Journey</h2>

                <p>
                    Today, I am halfway through my GSoC 2024 journey. The journey was so exciting and I'm aspiring for
                    more.
                    Talking about the tasks done, this week, I focused on handling the optional arguments for
                    compile-time evaluation of functions, specifically the <b>mask</b> argument for
                    <b>sum</b> intrinsic. With the new design, it works with the <b>mask</b> argument and
                    <b>dim = 1</b>. Following this, I added support for <b>mask</b> in <b>product</b>,
                    <b>iparity</b>, <b>minval</b>, and <b>maxval</b>, along with tests for them. While
                    doing that, I found that the implementation logic for complex arguments in <b>product</b> was
                    incorrect and spent some time resolving that.
                    <br>
                    Meanwhile, I cleaned up some unused and unnecessary code in the <b>name2signature</b> mapping.
                    <br>
                    A workaround for the <b>abs</b> function in the stdlib package was no longer needed, so I
                    removed it, added tests for the same, updated the CI hash, and opened a PR.
                    <br>
                    This week, I mainly focused on adding tests for intrinsics and ensuring they work for scalar/array
                    values at both compile-time and runtime. If any errors or divergences were found, I opened issues
                    for them. I've created a master list of all the intrinsics for which tests need to be added and
                    ensured that the implementations are robust. You can find the list here: <b><a
                            href="https://github.com/lfortran/lfortran/issues/3067">#3067</a></b>.
                    <br>
                    Additionally, I updated the integration tests for intrinsics, adding tests for both scalar and array
                    values at compile-time and runtime. I added tests for <b>sin</b>, <b>cos</b>, <b>tan</b>,
                    <b>dsin</b>, <b>dcos</b>, and <b>dtan</b>. Then, I added tests for <b>lgt</b>,
                    <b>llt</b>, <b>lle</b>, <b>lge</b>, <b>blt</b>, <b>bgt</b>,
                    <b>ble</b>, and <b>bge</b>.
                    <br>
                    While adding tests for <b>ibclr</b>, <b>ibset</b>, and <b>btest</b>, I found that
                    LFortran does not throw an error for negative values of the <b>pos</b> argument. So, I fixed
                    that. While adding tests for <b>digits</b>, <b>leadz</b>, and <b>trailz</b>, I
                    found several issues, such as incorrect output types and no support for array input in
                    <b>digits</b>. Additionally, <b>digits</b> is implemented as an elemental function, but
                    it should be an inquiry function. I opened issues for all these and will work on them next week.
                    <br>
                    I also analyzed the <b>selected_int_kind</b>, <b>selected_real_kind</b>, and
                    <b>selected_char_kind</b> functions and found that errors are not reported when non-scalar
                    arguments are passed or when the wrong type of arguments is passed.
                    <br>
                    The third-party code failure while implementing the <b>real</b> intrinsic is yet to be dealt
                    with. I'll also work on supporting optional arguments in array intrinsic functions.
                    <br>
                    For the upcoming week, I plan to work on the following tasks:
                <ul>
                    <li>Fix third-party code failure in the <b>real</b> intrinsic</li>
                    <li>Update integration tests for more intrinsics and fix related issues</li>
                    <li>Handle optional arguments for array intrinsics</li>
                    <li>Continue working on <b>SNAP</b> compilation</li>
                </ul>
                Progress tracker: <b><a href="https://github.com/lfortran/lfortran/issues/4017">#4017</a></b>.
                <br>
                Overall, I found this week's work engaging and am grateful to <b><a
                        href="https://github.com/certik">Ondřej Čertík</a></b> and the rest of the mentors at LFortran
                for their constant reviews and suggestions. I look forward to next week and am eager to complete the
                planned tasks.
