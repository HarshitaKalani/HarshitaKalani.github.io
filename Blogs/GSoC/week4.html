                <!-- <h2>Kicking Off GSoC: Intrinsic Functions and Compile-Time Evaluations in Week One</h2>
                <p>
                    This week marked the beginning of the coding period for GSoC, and I dived into implementing
                    intrinsic functions from scratch. I focused on adding compile-time evaluation support for various
                    array intrinsics. Specifically, I implemented compile-time support for the array intrinsic
                    functions, namely, sum, product, minVal, maxVal, and count. Additionally, I implemented a number of
                    elemental and array intrinsic functions from scratch, namely, spacing, nearest, iany, iall, and
                    norm2.
                    <br>
                    I began by adding compile-time support for the <b>sum, product, minval</b> and <b>maxval</b>
                    intrinsic function.
                    The current implementation does not yet handle optional arguments such as
                    dim and mask. This limitation also applies to the other array intrinsics I worked on. There is an
                    issue with the reshape intrinsic function, making it difficult to debug the dim argument. Therefore,
                    I am currently handling only the mandatory arguments and plan to address the optional ones soon.
                    <br>
                    Next week, I aim to resolve the <b>reshape</b> intrinsic issue and subsequently handle the optional
                    arguments for the array intrinsics.
                    <br>
                    Regarding the intrinsics I implemented from scratch, I started with the <b>spacing</b> intrinsic,
                    which
                    calculates the spacing between two consecutive floating-point numbers. For runtime implementation,
                    an ASR node needs to be created for the spacing function. The same applies to the <b>nearest</b>
                    intrinsic.
                    This has been documented as a separate issue, and a compiler exception is thrown for runtime values
                    for these functions.
                    <br>
                    I then implemented the <b>iany</b> and <b>iall</b> array intrinsics, which compute the bitwise OR
                    and AND of array
                    elements, respectively. Following that, I implemented the <b>norm2</b> intrinsic, which calculates
                    the
                    square root of the sum of the squares of array elements. A pull request for its implementation is
                    ready for review.
                    <br>
                    Additionally, I worked on moving the <b>merge</b> intrinsic from the Intrinsic Array functions to
                    the
                    Intrinsic Elemental functions, where it belongs. I also refactored the code for ArrayConstant,
                    replacing repetitive if-else conditions with switch cases to enhance readability, maintainability,
                    and execution speed.
                    <br>
                    While we support the <b>Fortran backend</b> for several intrinsics, not all are covered. I have
                    opened a
                    pull request to add Fortran backend support for the array intrinsics, which is ready for review.
                    <br>
                    For the upcoming week, I have several plans. I will address the reshape intrinsic function issue,
                    handle the optional arguments of array intrinsics, and work on the runtime implementation of the
                    spacing and nearest intrinsic by designing the ASR node. I also plan to add Fortran backend support
                    for the intrinsic elemental and inquiry functions, ensuring they run perfectly.
                    I have outlined a better approach for the Fortran backend in the pull request, and if it is approved
                    by my mentors, I will proceed with that. If I complete these tasks ahead of time, I will pick more
                    intrinsics to implement from scratch.
                    <br>
                    I've created an issue to keep a track of issues and PRs I'm working on. Here's a link for the same:
                    <b><a href="https://github.com/lfortran/lfortran/issues/4017">#4017</a></b>.
                    <br>
                    Overall, I found this week's work interesting and am grateful to<b><a
                            herf="https://github.com/certik"> Ondřej Čertík </a></b> and the rest of the mentors
                    at LFortran for their constant reviews and suggestions. I look forward to the next week and am eager
                    to complete the planned tasks.
