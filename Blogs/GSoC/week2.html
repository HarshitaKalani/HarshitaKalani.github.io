                <h2>Week 2 of GSoC 2024: Intrinsic Functions and Fortran Backend Progress</h2>
                <p>
                    Hey, welcome to my blog for week 2 of GSoC 2024! This week, I started working on registering the
                    intrinsic functions (array, elemental, and inquiry type) in the Fortran backend. I resolved issues
                    that arose and added tests for them. Almost all the intrinsics are now registered in the <b>Fortran
                        backend</b> and generate corresponding Fortran code with the <b>--show-fortran</b> flag.
                    <br>
                    Next, I cleaned up the code for array casting of different types and added a logical casting flag.
                    <br>
                    I then refactored the <b>kind</b> function from an elemental intrinsic to a type inquiry
                    intrinsic, where it belongs, and added support for compile-time reduction of elemental and inquiry
                    functions for extracting the kind. Additionally, I handled array type return types for array inputs
                    in elemental functions.
                    <br>
                    I'm currently working on implementing the <b>real</b> intrinsic. Several issues have come up,
                    such as those related to implied do loops and array slicing. I've created issues for these and will
                    address them next week.
                    <br>
                    While debugging, I found that the implementation logic for the <b>unpack</b> intrinsic was
                    incorrect, leading to wrong outputs. I submitted a PR to fix this, and it has been merged.
                    <br>
                    I then implemented another intrinsic named <b>dgamma</b> and prepared a list of all the
                    intrinsics that are yet to be implemented. You can find them in <b><a
                            href="https://github.com/lfortran/lfortran/issues/4017">#4017</a></b>.
                    <br>
                    I also worked on removing old code from the previous runtime library, which is one of the
                    deliverables of my GSoC journey.
                    <br>
                    I've completed the implementation of the <b>achar</b> intrinsic; however, one test case is
                    failing due to handling a null pointer. I will address this next week. I also looked into the
                    <b>reshape</b> intrinsic, but it needs more time.
                    <br>
                    For the upcoming week, I plan to work on the following tasks:
                <ul>
                    <li>Complete the implementation of the <b>real</b> intrinsic</li>
                    <li>Fix the failing test case for the <b>achar</b> intrinsic or find a workaround</li>
                    <li>Work on the <b>reshape</b> intrinsic</li>
                    <li>Implement the remaining intrinsics according to the tracker</li>
                </ul>
                Progress tracker: <b><a href="https://github.com/lfortran/lfortran/issues/4017">#4017</a></b>.
                <br>
                Overall, I found this week's work interesting and am grateful to <b><a
                        href="https://github.com/certik">Ondřej Čertík</a></b> and the rest of the mentors at LFortran
                for their constant reviews and suggestions. I look forward to next week and am eager to complete the
                planned tasks.
