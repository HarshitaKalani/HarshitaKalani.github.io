                <h2>Week 12 of GSoC 2024: Wrapping Up an Incredible Journey</h2>
                <p>
                    Hey everyone! How are y'all doing? Thanks for staying connected during this 12-week journey. Today
                    marks the last day of my GSoC tenure, and I'm thrilled to share my experiences and accomplishments.
                    <br>
                    Working with LFortran has been an incredible opportunity, and earning the GSoC badge is the cherry
                    on top. Over these 12 weeks, I've learned a lot and witnessed significant upgrades and achievements
                    in LFortran.
                    <br>
                    This week, I conducted a thorough analysis of many intrinsic functions, identifying numerous bugs
                    and opening issues for them. I resolved many of these issues and added tests to ensure robust
                    implementations. Additionally, I worked on the simplifier pass, tackling the final tricky tests,
                    which provided a deeper understanding of the LFortran codebase.
                    <br>
                    I've documented all the issues and PRs I've worked on during these 12 weeks here: <b><a
                            href="https://github.com/lfortran/lfortran/issues/4017">#4017</a></b>.
                    <br>
                    This entire journey has been incredibly exciting and educational. I'm immensely grateful to <b><a
                            href="https://github.com/certik">Ondřej Čertík</a></b> and all the mentors and contributors
                    at LFortran for their constant reviews and suggestions.
                    <br>
                    I'm excited to announce that I will continue contributing to LFortran, working on features that will
                    bring it closer to beta. I never imagined I would become a compiler developer, but this experience
                    has been thrilling, teaching me about the intricate journey from hardware to software in a system.
                    <br>
                    All contributors at LFortran are eager to help new contributors. If you want to explore the world of
                    open source, especially compilers, LFortran is the perfect place to start.
                    <br>
                    Thanks for staying tuned. I hope these blogs inspire you to contribute to open source projects. See
                    you around!
