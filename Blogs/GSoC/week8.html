                <h2>Week 8 of GSoC 2024: Enhancing Intrinsics and Introducing the Simplifier Pass</h2>
                <p>
                    Hello, I'm back with the blog post for week 8. This week, I focused on implementing the
                    <b>spread</b> intrinsic. I completed a basic implementation that handles 1D and 2D return
                    types. The PR was merged, but there are several improvements that can be addressed in subsequent
                    PRs.
                    <br>
                    This week, I also took on something new: working on the <b>simplifier pass</b>. This pass will help create
                    auxiliaries for expressions, ensuring that allocatables are only created when necessary. It will
                    also include a verifier to catch bugs early, preventing them from reaching the LLVM backend. This
                    refactoring will streamline and speed up multiple passes, making debugging and compiling larger
                    codes easier.
                    <br>
                    I had a meeting with Gagandeep, who initiated this project. He explained the working of this pass.
                    While the pass is almost implemented, there are several bugs that need to be fixed while executing
                    the integration tests. I'm working on them.
                    <br>
                    I then looked into the <b>ishftc</b>, <b>conjg</b>, and <b>bit_size</b> intrinsics
                    and added tests for them. During this process, I discovered that some intrinsics do not yet have
                    runtime implementations. I've opened an issue for this and believe we should at least throw an error
                    indicating that the intrinsic is not yet implemented for runtime parameters.
                    <br>
                    In the weekly meeting with Ondřej, we discussed the issues with handling <b>optional arguments</b> for
                    array intrinsics. We developed a plan for addressing these issues, and I have started working on it.
                    I'll soon open a PR and continue working on it next week, along with the simplifier pass.
                    <br>
                    For the upcoming week, I plan to work on the following tasks:
                <ul>
                    <li>Continue working on the simplifier pass</li>
                    <li>Support optional arguments for <b>minloc</b> and <b>maxloc</b></li>
                    <li>Add integration tests and resolve bugs related to intrinsics</li>
                </ul>
                Progress tracker: <b><a href="https://github.com/lfortran/lfortran/issues/4017">#4017</a></b>.
                <br>
                I found this week's work really exciting and am grateful to <b><a
                        href="https://github.com/certik">Ondřej Čertík</a></b> and the rest of the mentors at LFortran
                for their constant reviews and suggestions. I look forward to next week and am eager to complete the
                planned tasks. Stay tuned for more updates!
