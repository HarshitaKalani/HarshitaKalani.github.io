                <h2>Week 7 of GSoC 2024: Tackling Intrinsic Functions and Compilation Challenges</h2>
                <p>
                    Hey there, I'm back with another blog post. This week, I focused on updating the integration tests
                    for several intrinsics like <b>epsilon</b>, <b>precision</b>, <b>ior</b>,
                    <b>ieor</b>, and <b>iand</b>. I opened issues for the bugs found in them and added
                    support for handling array input to inquiry functions.
                    <br>
                    I added tests for <b>not</b>, <b>or</b>, <b>and</b>, and <b>xor</b> and
                    realized that these intrinsics are implemented through mapping with <b>ior</b>,
                    <b>iand</b>, and <b>ieor</b>, which do not support logical arguments. I opened an issue
                    for that and will address them.
                    <br>
                    I then examined <b>selected_real_kind</b>, <b>selected_int_kind</b>, and
                    <b>selected_char_kind</b> and found that these intrinsics only support scalar input and need
                    refactoring. An issue has been opened for that as well.
                    <br>
                    Next, I looked into <b>tiny</b> and <b>huge</b> and found issues related to arithmetic
                    overflow. I addressed these issues and opened a PR to add tests for <b>maxexponent</b>,
                    <b>minexponent</b>, <b>radix</b>, <b>range</b>, and <b>hypot</b>, solving
                    related issues. <b>Maxexponent</b> and <b>minexponent</b> were implemented as elemental
                    functions, but they are actually inquiry functions, so I refactored them.
                    <br>
                    Additionally, I updated the automatic Python script to ensure that the kind of the arguments in
                    various intrinsics are equal. I've maintained a track of this here: <b><a
                            href="https://github.com/lfortran/lfortran/issues/3067">#3067</a></b>.
                    <br>
                    I investigated issues encountered during compiling PRIMA, related to intrinsics such as support for
                    the <b>spread</b> intrinsic function and the <b>mask</b> and <b>back</b> arguments
                    for <b>minloc</b> and <b>maxloc</b>. I am currently working on implementing the
                    <b>spread</b> intrinsic. The compile-time implementation is complete, and I will work on the
                    runtime implementation next week.
                    <br>
                    Earlier, I worked on the optional arguments for <b>minloc</b> and <b>maxloc</b>. Some
                    tests are failing with that implementation, so I will look into that as well.
                    <br>
                    I ended the week with a workaround for the <b>real</b> intrinsic, which was failing due to
                    third-party code. I explored the issue but have yet to resolve it fully. For now, I made a
                    workaround in the stdlib and opened an issue. With the workaround, the PR is now merged, but it
                    needs proper refactoring to maintain performance.
                    <br>
                    For the upcoming week, I plan to work on the following tasks:
                <ul>
                    <li>Complete the implementation of the <b>spread</b> intrinsic</li>
                    <li>Support <b>mask</b> and <b>back</b> arguments for <b>minloc</b> and
                        <b>maxloc</b></li>
                    <li>Add integration tests and resolve bugs related to intrinsics</li>
                    <li>Work on <b>PRIMA</b> and <b>SNAP</b> compilation</li>
                </ul>
                Progress tracker: <b><a href="https://github.com/lfortran/lfortran/issues/4017">#4017</a></b>.
                <br>
                I found this week's work really exciting and am grateful to <b><a
                        href="https://github.com/certik">Ondřej Čertík</a></b> and the rest of the mentors at LFortran
                for their constant reviews and suggestions. I look forward to next week and am eager to complete the
                planned tasks.
                Stay tuned for more updates!
