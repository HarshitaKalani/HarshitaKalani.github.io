                <h2>Week 5 of GSoC 2024: Tackling Intrinsics and Integrating New Features</h2>
                <p>
                    Hello, welcome back to my weekly blog on GSoC 2024 progress. This week, I started by resolving
                    issues related to real intrinsic as mentioned in the last blog.
                    I fixed the use of nested intrinsics like <b>sum</b>. After handling that, two of
                    the checks failed: one was an issue in the third-party code and the other related to WebAssembly
                    (WASM). I worked on resolving the WASM issue and was able to resolve
                    it. Thanks to Ubaid and Ondrej for the guidance.
                    I've created a Minimal Reproducible Example (MRE) for the third-party code failure and will address
                    it next week.
                    <br>
                    I investigated the <b>same_as_type</b> intrinsic, which is currently giving incorrect output.
                    The issue seems to be with type handling when changed with allocation. I'll discuss this with my
                    mentors and try to resolve it.
                    <br>
                    I reviewed the implementation of array intrinsics <b>cshift</b> and <b>eoshift</b>. They
                    now work fine for one-dimensional arrays. My goal is to make these array intrinsics handle optional
                    arguments as well. For this, I continued working on the PR related to handling optional arguments in
                    <b>minloc</b> and <b>maxloc</b>. The design mentioned in the last blog caused runtime
                    test failures, so I've devised another method to handle this and will complete it next week. If
                    finished early, I'll handle optional arguments for more array intrinsics.
                    <br>
                    The third-party code failure in <b>len_trim</b> and <b>trim</b> functions was due to an
                    issue with handling generics. I realized that a design change is needed to resolve this, which is
                    currently a low priority. Thanks to Pranav for the help. I'll look for another workaround.
                    <br>
                    This week, I also updated the integration tests for intrinsics, adding tests for both scalar and
                    array at compile-time and runtime. I added tests for <b>verify</b>, <b>index</b>,
                    <b>scan</b>, <b>adjustl</b>, and <b>adjustr</b>. While adding tests for
                    <b>erf</b>, <b>erfc</b>, <b>derf</b>, and <b>derfc</b>, I realized that we
                    don't support arrays for intrinsics implemented with intrinsic mapping, so I fixed that. I'll add
                    tests for the remaining intrinsics next week.
                    <br>
                    I then restarted working on <b>SNAP</b> compilation, commenting out the non-functional parts and pushing the
                    changes. I investigated an issue related to handling tuples and will look into it in-depth next
                    week.
                    <br>
                    For the upcoming week, I plan to work on the following tasks:
                <ul>
                    <li>Fix third-party code failure in the <b>real</b> intrinsic</li>
                    <li>Update integration tests for more intrinsics and fix related issues</li>
                    <li>Implement the remaining intrinsics</li>
                    <li>Handle optional arguments for array intrinsics</li>
                    <li>Continue working on <b>SNAP</b> compilation</li>
                    <li>Debug <b>check_equal_type</b> function to fix <b>same_as_type</b> intrinsic</li>
                    <li>Generalize intrinsic registration in the <b>ASR to C, C++, and Julia backend</b></li>
                </ul>
                Progress tracker: <b><a href="https://github.com/lfortran/lfortran/issues/4017">#4017</a></b>.
                <br>
                Overall, I found this week's work engaging and am grateful to <b><a
                        href="https://github.com/certik">Ondřej Čertík</a></b> and the rest of the mentors at LFortran
                for their constant reviews and suggestions. I look forward to next week and am eager to complete the
                planned tasks.
