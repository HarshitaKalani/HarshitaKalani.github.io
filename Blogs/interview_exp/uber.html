                <p>
                    Uber came for oncampus hiring in our college (IIT Jodhpur). There were total 4 rounds.
                    <br>
                    <b>1st round - Online assessment (Coding round):</b> There were 3 questions in the coding round. The
                    difficulty level was tough. The first question gauged my skill in optimizing solutions by breaking
                    intricate problems into manageable subproblems. I utilized dynamic programming data structures like
                    memoization arrays to efficiently store and retrieve intermediate results. The second question dealt
                    with determining the maximum number of boxes that can fit into another box, considering height and
                    width constraints. The final question focused on number systems, requiring the conversion of a given
                    number from base 2 to base 6. Basic data structures like arrays or strings were used for
                    representing numbers during the conversion process.

                    I cleared the first round and reached to the second round.
                    <br>
                    <b>2nd round - System Design:</b> This round was more of technical round where the interviewer first
                    asked me about my introduction and then asked me a question related to system designing. I'd to tell
                    about the design of a system which checks for the arrival and departure of passangers on an airport
                    and calculate the duration of time they stay there. I coded everything and was selected for the next
                    round.
                    <br>
                    <b>3rd round - Technical round:</b> In the third round, I was asked to code a question related to
                    graphs. I don't remember the question exactly but it was more of travel between cities question. I
                    solved that question but feel that I look a little longer optimising it.
                    <br>
                    It was a nice experience. I wish you the best of luck! Just stay patient and keep interacting with
                    the interviewer throughout the interview.<br>
