                    Google came for oncampus hiring for the role of summer internship. There was a coding round and then
                    2 technical interviews.
                    <br>
                    <b>1st round - The online assessment (Coding round)</b> - The online coding round has 2 questions.
                    The questions were medium to hard level. I was able to complete both the questions but could only
                    pass partial test cases. Almost a month later, we go the results and I was selected for the
                    interview round.
                    <br>
                    <b>2nd round - Technical interview</b> - The interview started with the interviewer introducing
                    himself and asked me about my introduction. Then he presented a DSA question related to dynamic
                    programming in google docs. I vaguely remember the question. It was related to mountains height
                    which can be decreased by 1 in every step and I'd to find the minimum steps to do something. I was
                    able to do it correctly and optimise it. He then asked me the time and space complexity. In an hour,
                    I got a mail for the next round.
                    <br>
                    <b>3rd round - Technical interview - 2</b> - In the second interview, the interviewer directly
                    started with the question. The question went like this - "A kid has an uncle who wants to gift him
                    something. The price of the gift increases by some percentage and also, the salary of uncle increase
                    by some function. I'd to find the best time for the uncle to buy the gift." It had concepts of
                    backtracking and dynamic programming. I could tell the approach but could not code the complete
                    question in 45mins.
                    <br>
                    It was a nice experience but I think I could have done better. All the best to you!
