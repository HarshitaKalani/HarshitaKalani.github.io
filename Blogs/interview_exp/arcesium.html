                <p>
                    Arcesium came for oncampus intern hiring in our college (IIT Jodhpur). It had 4 rounds: First was
                    online coding round where they asked 15 questions based on quantative aptitude, 15 questions on CS
                    fundamentals which included DBMS, OS, Computer networks and OOPS. There was negative marking too.
                    Then there were two coding questions with medium level difficulty to be done in 45 minutes.<br>

                    The next day, some of the students were selected for the next round which was technical interview -
                    round 1. I was selected for the same and they asked me a question based on graphs. I was able to do
                    that. This round was eliminatory in nature. So some were selected for technical round - 2. In this
                    round I was asked the some topic that I know in CS fundamentals. I said OOPS. They asked me
                    questions on OOPS - some were theoretical and other were to code.
                    <br>
                    Some of my friends were asked questions on sorting algorithms and were asked to expalin them. I was
                    not selected for the next round but it was managerial round (HR) where they talked about the
                    behaviour and principles. And asked about some of the projects.
                    <br>
                    I would wish you best of luck and recommend you to go through all the topics related to CS
                    fundamentals.<br>
