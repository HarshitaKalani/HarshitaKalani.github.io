                    Warner Bros. Discovery came for oncampus hiring. There were total 4 rounds for the position of
                    summer intern. The first round was shortlisting round and the rest 3 went continuous with no
                    elimination.

                    <b>1st round: Online assessment –</b> This stage of the process consisted of 25 questions. Among
                    these, 5 questions required a video response, where you would address general topics such as
                    introducing yourself, explaining your motivation for joining, some joyful questions like which is
                    your favourite show and what do you like about it, highlighting your potential contributions, and
                    listing the technologies or frameworks you are familiar with. The remaining set of 20 questions was
                    comprised of multiple-choice questions focusing on Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), Databse
                    management system (DBMS) and Operating systems(OS). It's important to maintain confidence in your
                    verbal responses.

                    <b>2nd round: Technical round –</b> The interview started with "tell us about yourself". There were
                    two persons taking the interview. I told about myself and then he put the question. I vaguely
                    remember the question. It was related to recommendation of shows on an OTT platform. He asked me how
                    will I proceed if I'm asked to recommend some show with very less time and nice space complexity. I
                    told them the approach and he then asked me if I can go for caching and asked me some concepts of
                    memory utilization and database which I'll use for this question. I was able to answer and it ended.
                    It went for almost 30-45 minutes.

                    <b>3rd round: Technical and managerial round –</b> This round started with the manager asking me
                    about me and then about round 2. We discussed a little more about the questions that were asked in
                    round 2 and came up with more efficient solution and then asked me about my projects and the
                    approach I use to complete them.

                    <b>4th round: People and Culture round –</b> This round was mostly to learn about you and your
                    approach towards work. They look for excitement and ask questions like: "tell about one of your
                    favourite projects, how did you manage to complete it. Did you go for team work? Have you been a
                    leader? and so". Then she asked me about the location I would prefer to stay at. And it ended quite
                    well.

                    PS: I got the job offer the next day of the interviews. Wish you best of luck!
