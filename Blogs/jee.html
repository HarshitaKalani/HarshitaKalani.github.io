          I have a mixed range of emotions when it comes to my JEE experience.
          Looking back, those were the days filled with a rollercoaster of
          emotions, where laughter and tears intertwined. As I approached the
          end of my 10th grade, I hadn't even heard about JEE or IIT. Back
          then, I had dreams of becoming a doctor, and I was focused on
          pursuing biology. However, deep down, I had an intense love for
          mathematics that I couldn't ignore. It was painful for me to let go
          of my passion. Fortunately, my father's friend suggested that I
          consider switching to PCM (Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics) and give
          JEE a shot. The idea appealed to me because it meant I could
          continue studying mathematics, which I loved so much. I enrolled at
          VMC (Vidyamandir Classes), and that marked the beginning of my
          journey. I became a dedicated student and diligently completed all
          the assignments given by my teachers. Time flew by, and before I
          knew it, the day of the JEE Main exam arrived. I gave my best and
          achieved a remarkable percentile of 99.2. My parents and I were
          thrilled to be among the top 0.8% of test-takers. However, there
          were people who guided me and made me realize that this wasn't
          enough. Encouraged by their support, I continued to practice and
          study hard, even when the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted everything.
          The second opportunity came with JEE Main paper 2, and I was
          overjoyed to score 99.4% this time. It was a stepping stone towards
          the ultimate goal of JEE Advanced. With determination, I gave it my
          all and secured an All India Rank (AIR) of 5588. Now, I find myself
          sitting at IIT Jodhpur, pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer
          Science and Engineering (BTech CSE). I can genuinely say that I am
          happy here. This journey has been transformative, and I have learned
          so much along the way. Above all, I have made my family and friends
          proud, and that means the world to me.
