					Hey, I've recently started contributing to open source. I'm currently contributing to the
					development of LFortran, a modern Fortran compiler.
					I'm specifically focussing on AST to LLVM compilation and integrating SciPy
					intrinsic functions like maxval, min, sign, etc.
					I wrote the above 2 lines almost an year ago. I'm back today to share how had been the year
					when I learnt a lot about open source, git, compilers, fortran and much more.
					I started contributing to Stdlib-js where I solved one or two issues and found it interesting.
					Then I moved to LFortran and I've been contributing to it since then.
					Starting from solving random issues to implementing new features and reviewing PRs, I've really
					enjoyed my journey doing all this. And now, I'm doing GSoC with it.
					I'd never really thought I would someday be doing this. The lucky day when Pranav came and suggested
					me
					to give LFortran a try. Although it was tough to pick up the codebase initially, but I'm glad I did.
					I started with picking up issues related to throwing errors and warnings for some invalid code. Then
					I worked
					on dedicated SciPy compilation and felt proud when we could compile 60% of SciPy with LFortran.

					I did my BTech project on LFortran and it was a great experience. Then I moved on stdlib and finally
					focussing on implementing the intrinsic functions as my GSoC project.
					The weekly meetings with Ondrej are really helpful.
					Today is one of the exciting days when we are able to compile the example from fortran discourse and
					proudly we compile it faster that other compilers. And what is more exciting
					is that I've got the highest number of commits for that, haha :)
					Cherry on top, Ondrej mentioned me in the twitter post and Fortran discourse as well. And we've got
					a linkedin
					post done for that as well.
					I'll share the links here so that you can have a look at them.
					Thanks for your time, I'll be back with more updates soon.
